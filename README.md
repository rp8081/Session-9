# Session-9

In this assignment, we are implementing GRADCAM .

## PART A 

<p> We have used 6A code to run the model(cifar10 data set)  . We have selected 994,1005,1009 and 1070 and implemented GRADCAM on them. Given below are original image and their superimposed image.<p>

## PART B (with cut out)

<p> We have selected same image (as in part A).But this time model is trained with cut out.
Given below are original image and their superimposed image.<p>
  
 Actiavtion seems to have more spread while using cutout.
